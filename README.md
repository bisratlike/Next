# Next.js CRUD Progress Repo

This repository is designed to help me explore and deepen my understanding of Next.js by building simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications. The repo contains three folders, each representing a separate CRUD operation implementation.

## Folder Structure

- **1st folder/**: Implements the basic structure and functionality for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Next.js and drizzle
- **2nd folder/**: Builds on the previous folder with additional features or improvements, focusing on refining the CRUD operations and the my Ai
- **3rd folder/**: it is implemented by  Prizma

Each folder contains a fully functional CRUD app, and the goal is to gradually improve and expand my Next.js knowledge by working through these implementations.

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to practice and solidify my understanding of Next.js, particularly in building applications that manage data through CRUD operations. The repeated folder structure allows me to compare different approaches and refine my skills as I progress.
