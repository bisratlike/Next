# Next.js CRUD Progress Repo

Tthis repository is designed to help me explore and deepen my understanding of Next.js by building simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications. The repo contains three folders, each representing a separate CRUD operation implementation.

## Folder Structure

- **1st folder/**- (crud with drizzle good ui): Implements the basic structure and functionality for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  of user using Next.js and drizzle,  mantaine and tailwind for the ui
- **2nd folder/**:  (crud with drizzle no css basic)  Implements the basic structure and functionality for CRUD  of user using Next , drizzle and some css.
- **3rd folder/**: (crud with prizma)  Implements the basic structure and functionality for CRUD  of user using Next ,Prizma and mantaine and tailwind for the ui

Each folder contains a fully functional CRUD  and the goal is to gradually improve and expand my Next.js knowledge by working through these implementations.

## Goal

The purpose of this repository is to practice and solidify my understanding of Next.js, particularly in building and manage data through CRUD operations. The repeated folder structure allows me to compare different approaches and refine my skills as I progress.
